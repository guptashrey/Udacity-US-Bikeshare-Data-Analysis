# Udacity-US-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis
Udacity Machine Learning Foundation Nanodegree Project - Analysing Bikeshare Data.

## Description

Use Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major systems
in the US. The data will need to be munged into shape before being analyzed using
descriptive statistics before being visualised.

The purpose of this task is to continue to become familliar with the data
analysis process.

* This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
* The code should run w/o errors.
* Appropriate use of
    * data structures/types
    * loops/conditional statements
    * Packages
    * functions
    * coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general
      readability)
* Analysis
    * Pose two questions about the data
    * Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
    * Clean the data
    * Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
    * Visualize the data (instead of using plt use seaborn or ggplot)
    * Perform additional exploratory analysis
    * Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields

## File Descriptions

* ./data/ contains the various datasets
* ./examples/ contains an example of the data cleaning process
* ./2016_US_Bikeshare_Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the work I have done
* ./2016_US_Bikeshare_Analysis.pdf is an exported version of the above file
using LaTeX
* ./Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the "skeleton"
code for this project
